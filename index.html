                            I'm <span class="highlight">Neelesh</span> — a Computer Science graduate with a focus on Gaming Technology.
                            Right now, I’m learning full-stack development with Java while designing my first
                            fully narrative-driven game, <span class="highlight">OFFLINE</span> — an interactive mystery adventure inspired by <ins>ZORK</ins>.

                        <p>
                            I like building systems that feel alive — from quick Python tools to 3D prototypes in Unreal Engine.
                            Most of what I know came from experimenting, failing, debugging at weird hours, and somehow making it work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’m curious about how games actually *feel* to play — which pulled me into:

                            <p class="intro">A cinematic prototype built in Unreal.</p>

                            <p>
                                <span class="highlight">Lost in Castle</span> was my final semester project (Jan – May 2025) —
                                a third-person action-adventure prototype built with Unreal Engine 5.
                                I wanted to explore how <span class="highlight">camera work</span> can shape how players feel,
                                not just what they see.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Inspired by <em>Silent Hill</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em>, I built a system that blends
                                <span class="highlight">fixed angles</span> with <span class="highlight">spline-following cinematic cameras</span>.
                                Movement used classic <span class="highlight">tank controls</span>, which — surprisingly —
                                worked well with the dramatic camera shifts and added to the tension.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The prototype includes basic <span class="highlight">combat, enemy AI (via behavior trees), and interaction systems</span>,
                                all done through Blueprints. Even without full levels or smart enemies, it feels like a game that *could* exist.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Most of my focus was on getting the camera transitions to feel smooth — blending from static shots
                                to dynamic tracking paths using <span class="highlight">trigger volumes and splines</span>.
                                The system actually worked better than I expected — but only when everything was planned down to the decimal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I learned why this style fell out of favor: it demands absurd precision.
                                Misplacing a trigger by a few units could break the camera logic or cause blind spots.
                                You have to decide exactly what you want players to see, when, and how it should feel.
                                That gave me a whole new respect for how effortlessly games like <em>Silent Hill (1999)</em> pulled it off.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s a lost art, honestly. I’d love to revisit this someday — and actually build a full game that leans into this
                                kind of cinematic control.
                            </p>

                            <p class="intro">Motion Capture Tool built with Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV</p>

                            <p>
                                <span class="highlight">Motion Capture Tool</span> was my minor project for Semester 7 (Aug – Nov 2024),
                                where I tried building a DIY motion-capture pipeline using Python and open-source tools —
                                no fancy suits or studio setups.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It works by detecting <span class="highlight">pose, face, and hand landmarks</span> in real-time
                                using <span class="highlight">MediaPipe</span>, then exporting that motion data as a
                                timestamped <span class="highlight">JSON file</span> that’s game-engine ready.
                                The goal was to generate simple animations using just a webcam or phone camera.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I built a custom interface with Python and Pygame where users can switch between camera inputs,
                                record motion clips, and watch live pose tracking as they move.
                                While I didn’t get to test it directly inside Unreal Engine, the export logic is there —
                                the JSON is clean, structured, and ready to rig.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Most of the heavy lifting — like pose estimation and JSON structuring — was done by adapting
                                open-source code with a *lot* of AI help (a little thing called vibe coding).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The whole idea was to make animation more accessible — especially for solo devs or indies
                                without expensive mocap gear. Honestly, I had zero idea how this worked before,
                                but with a bit of trial, error, and AI assistance, I managed to ship a working prototype.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s rough around the edges, sure — but it taught me a lot about <span class="highlight">data flow, pose estimation, and real-time input handling</span>.
                                I’d love to revisit this someday and take it one step further into actual skeletal animation.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <span class="highlight">PLAY 90s</span> was my first hands-on game project — a tiny collection
                                of retro-inspired games built while exploring game dev basics through Harvard’s CS50x course.
                                It’s offline, fast to boot, and designed to feel like the kind of games you’d play on a school computer in the 2000s.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I made two games with multiple variations:
                                <span class="highlight">Pong</span> with both 1P (vs CPU) and 2P modes,
                                available in classic black-and-white and a color-upgrade version.
                                Then a <span class="highlight">Flappy Bird</span> clone — first the standard version,
                                and then a reboot called <span class="highlight">Fly-UFO</span> with a neon city, alien sprite, and a parallax-scrolling sky.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I mostly just wanted to understand how simple games *work* — drawing loops, input handling, collision, score tracking.
                                It’s not advanced or polished, but finishing this gave me the confidence to keep building games beyond tutorials.

                            <p>
                                I built this retro-inspired <span class="highlight">text adventure engine</span> after getting curious about how games like <span class="highlight">Zork</span> worked before graphics existed.
                                It’s not a full game — more of a design experiment to test out <span class="highlight">typed commands</span> like <code>move left</code>, <code>take key</code>, <code>use terminal</code>,
                                and how to manage those in a minimal UI.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The prototype includes:
                                - a glowing CRT-style <span class="highlight">text renderer</span>
                                - a responsive <span class="highlight">command parser</span> and scrollable message log
                                - <span class="highlight">3D skull renderer</span> that rotates in real-time
                                - custom <span class="highlight">procedural sound effects</span> (startup, typing, errors, etc.)
                                — all handled via <span class="highlight">Pygame</span> with no external assets.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Honestly, I didn’t know where this was going — I just started vibe coding after a late-night chat about interactive fiction 
                                with <span class="highlight">ChatGPT</span> and <span class="highlight">Claude</span>. 
                                Every system was vibe-coded into modules: text manager, game state, 3D renderer, sound manager. 
                                No engine. No framework. Just one window, one keyboard, and a glowing cursor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s weirdly satisfying watching a fake terminal blink while you type “look around.” 
                                I might evolve this into a full parser game someday... or just keep it as a time capsule from when I discovered how old games thought.

                            <p>
                                I ended up building not one, but <span class="highlight">two versions</span> of this — one for shader experiments, another to explore themes and transparency. 
                                Both born from a single goal: mess with retro visuals until they looked like a CRT fever dream.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This first version is built entirely in <span class="highlight">Pygame</span>, recreating Snake inside a retro CRT aesthetic with glowing scanlines and <span class="highlight">manually rendered 3D shapes</span> rotating in every corner. 
                                I handled everything from <span class="highlight">vector math</span> to <span class="highlight">phosphor beam effects</span> — no engines, no shaders, just pixels.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Not gonna lie — most of the heavy lifting was done by <span class="highlight">ChatGPT</span> and <span class="highlight">Claude</span>. 
                                I just supplied the idea, the visuals I wanted, and some late-night energy. They wrote most of the code. I rewired, stitched, and polished it into this haunted arcade demo.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The highlight? The glowing scanline isn’t just for show — it reacts in real-time when it sweeps over the snake or food. Feels like you're playing inside a dying monitor with attitude.
                            </p>

                            <p class="intro">
                                Did I build Snake? Not really. Did I vibe-code the heck out of it with AI? Absolutely.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This version of <span class="highlight">CRT Snake</span> was coded in both <span class="highlight">Python</span> and <span class="highlight">Java</span>, but the <strong>Java build won</strong> — smoother alpha rendering, pixel-perfect CRT effects, and that sweet, crisp look only Java2D gives when you treat it like a shader lab.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Every <span class="highlight">5 points</span>, the game cycles to a new retro theme: 
                                from glowing green terminals to warm amber monitors to chunky blue pixel styles with banding and noise. 
                                The CRT isn't just for looks — the screen has <span class="highlight">scanlines, ghost trails, phosphor glow, chunky pixel overlays, banding artifacts</span>, and a moving beamline that reacts to gameplay in real-time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Built completely in <span class="highlight">pure Java Swing</span> (and optionally <span class="highlight">Pygame</span> for the Python version), 
                                this project started as a shader test and spiraled into a dual-engine CRT love letter. 
                                I wrote zero real logic — everything was co-written by <span class="highlight">ChatGPT</span> and <span class="highlight">Claude</span>. 
                                I just vibed the idea into existence.

                                Old-school Hangman reimagined as a CRT terminal game — green glow, ASCII borders, and that 80s hacker vibe.

                            <p>
                                <span class="highlight">CRT_Hangman</span> is a terminal-based rework of the classic 
                                word-guessing game, styled like it’s running on an old green-screen monitor. 
                                It uses a <span class="highlight">bordered ASCII UI</span>, glowing text 
                                via <code>colorama</code>, and a subtle <span class="highlight">scanline-style refresh effect</span> 
                                to sell the vintage vibe.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This was more of a retro design experiment than a game challenge — 
                                a simple Python build with some UI polish. 
                                The <span class="highlight">hangman figure</span> is rendered stage-by-stage 
                                in text art, and the whole thing is wrapped in a CRT-styled frame that redraws 
                                like an old screen refreshing line by line.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I worked on this with <span class="highlight">ChatGPT</span> and <span class="highlight">Claude</span>, 
                                mostly tossing in the ideas and letting them handle the code. 
                                Quick build, fun aesthetic, satisfying little side project.

                                    A 2D sprite dropped into a full 3D Unreal Engine world — looked cool, played rough. 
                                    This prototype exposed every camera flaw I’d fix in the next one.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This was my first experiment mixing a <span class="highlight">2D character</span> 
                                    with a fully 3D environment in Unreal Engine. The camera was locked to face the sprite directly 
                                    — almost like watching a stage play — and the sprite itself came from <span class="highlight">Itch.io</span>, 
                                    while the environment was kitbashed from the <span class="highlight">UE Marketplace</span>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While the effect looked interesting at first, the limitations showed up quickly: 
                                    the camera <span class="highlight">got stuck behind walls</span>, large props 
                                    <span class="highlight">obscured the player</span>, and anything overhead could 
                                    <span class="highlight">completely block the view</span>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It wasn’t playable — not without serious camera logic. But this prototype became the 
                                    foundation for my next project, where I’d start fixing every one of these problems.
                                </p>

                                    Zoom in. Zoom out. Flip perspective. This prototype gave my HD_2D characters a camera system they could finally breathe in.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    After the issues in my first HD_2D character test — walls blocking the player, camera getting stuck, zero rotation — I decided to rebuild the camera system from scratch. Not to give full modern control, but just enough flexibility to keep the player visible and the environment readable.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This prototype added <span class="highlight">zoom control</span> (via up/down arrows) and a <span class="highlight">3-angle toggle</span> (via the <code>C</code> key) to flip between three fixed but distinct views — straight-on, slightly angled, and almost top-down. These weren't true orbiting cameras, but simple swaps that made a big difference in visibility.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The biggest breakthrough was <span class="highlight">occlusion masking</span>. Using a depth-based material trick (from Unreal’s own training video: “Depth & Location Based Effects”), I made any obstructing 3D walls or props fade out when they blocked the sprite. It wasn’t perfect, but suddenly the character was no longer lost behind crates or stairs.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    All logic was done in <span class="highlight">Blueprints</span> — no plugins, no C++. Just trial, error, and slowly wiring together a more playable HD_2D camera system.
                                </p>

                                    A rough cinematic test that helped me realize how far my dream project still is — and how badly I want to reach it.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This short teaser was built inside <span class="highlight">Unreal Engine 5</span> as a visual spark for a much bigger story — 
                                    my dream project, <span class="highlight">My Last Breath</span>. It was loosely inspired by narrative games like 
                                    <em>The Walking Dead</em>, and focused on a grieving survivor trying to carry the weight left behind by a woman named Yuki.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Yuki saved the protagonist and a group of other survivors — a baby named Alita, and an older man named Frank — but she didn’t make it. 
                                    The teaser shows the aftermath: memory, loss, and reluctant leadership in an apocalyptic world where survival is brutal.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I used <span class="highlight">kitbashed environments</span>, <span class="highlight">Metahumans</span>, 
                                    AI-generated dialogue from ElevenLabs, <span class="highlight">Mixamo animations</span>, and rendered it all using 
                                    <span class="highlight">UE5’s sequencer and cinematic camera system</span>. But honestly — the scenes were 
                                    poorly optimized, badly timed, and struggled with heavy lag and compression artifacts.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Still, I learned more than I expected. I spent a whole day animating a subtle smile on Yuki’s face — my first time working 
                                    with facial rigs. That moment taught me how hard animation really is — and how powerful even a small gesture can be when it works.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This video didn’t turn out great. But it gave me a reality check: no one shows how hard it is to make something from nothing. 
                                    Behind every polished scene are weeks of chaos. I uploaded it anyway. 100 views, 8 likes (including mine). But I’m proud I tried.

                                    When Niagara melted my laptop, I had to rethink how fire even works.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This wasn’t just a torch effect — it was a crash course in optimization, layering, and stylized art.
                                    I was working on my action-adventure project <span class="highlight">Lost in Castle</span>, 
                                    and my original fire system used Unreal’s <span class="highlight">Niagara particle system</span> with thousands of particles per torch.
                                    It looked okay… until I had a dozen torches. Frame rate dropped. Lighting washed out. Everything turned into a wall of glowing white.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    So I scrapped it and rebuilt the fire from scratch using a <span class="highlight">layered shader approach</span>.
                                    Inspired by <em>Diablo III’s</em> effects breakdown in the link given below (if any one's interested),
                                    I used texture blending and panning instead of brute force particles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I hand-drew a stylized flame shape in <span class="highlight">Photoshop</span>,
                                    then layered it with 2–3 scrolling noise textures to simulate motion and distortion.
                                    No flipbooks. No baked simulations. Just <span class="highlight">alpha-masked planes with clever math</span>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Once the base material was set, I applied it to a minimal Niagara setup —
                                    around <span class="highlight">10–20 particles max per torch</span>.
                                    The result? More readable fire, stylized glow, and a dramatic cut in GPU load.
                                    It looked closer to <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> than I expected — not exact, but on the right path.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This wasn’t just an effect — it became a reminder that performance and style aren’t opposites.
                                    And it deserves its own slot, separate from the rest of the project that made it necessary.
                                </p>

                                    <span class="highlight">Ben 10 Runner</span> was my introduction to both Python and Pygame — a fully playable endless runner game, and the first time I ever felt like I’d “finished” something real. 
                                    It started as a simple YouTube tutorial, but quickly spiraled into something of my own.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I added <span class="highlight">parallax backgrounds</span>, <span class="highlight">enemy animations</span>, and even experimented with a power-up system where Ben could transform into aliens — though I eventually removed it due to bugs and balance issues. 
                                    (Some of the old code still lingers in the files as proof of that brief experiment.)

                                    I didn’t release this game publicly — most of the assets came from random sources and I didn’t track licenses at the time. But it remains my most cherished project, because it’s what made me realize how fun and addictive game development can be.

                                    A weekend rabbit hole into how DOOM faked 3D in 1993.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This was a spontaneous project, born after watching a YouTube video about the original <em>DOOM</em>. I asked myself, 
                                    “How did they make 3D games without real 3D engines?” The answer was <span class="highlight">raycasting</span> — a clever illusion built with trigonometry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I followed tutorials from creators like <em>monkey see monkey do</em> and <em>FinFet</em>, breaking down the math behind early 90s engines. 
                                    It blew my mind how simple formulas could trick the eye into seeing depth.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It’s not a real 3D engine — you can’t look up or down — but it felt like uncovering game dev archaeology. 
                                    Bonus trivia: John Carmack and Romero didn’t use version control while building DOOM. Insane.
